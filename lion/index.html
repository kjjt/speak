						<h5>ART WORK BY MARIANA CANALES</h5>
						<p> Lions are large felines that are traditionally depicted as the "king of the jungle." These big cats once roamed Africa, Asia and Europe. However, now they are found in only two areas of the world and are classified into two subspecies. Asiatic lions live in India.</p>
